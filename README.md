## Description

This repository contains the implementation of the CPC benchmark, initially introduced with 25 discontinuous and nonlinear function minimization problems. These problems are designed to test algorithmic performance under conditions of discontinuity, nonlinearity, and sensitivity to numerical precision. 

Future extensions of CPC will include additional discontinuous and nonlinear minimization problems, as well as other categories such as equation solving, curve fitting, and black-box optimization. Each problem includes detailed data and the currently known best solutions to facilitate systematic evaluation and fair comparison of optimization algorithms.
